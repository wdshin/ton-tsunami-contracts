# Tsunami exchange TON contracts

Welcome to the Tsunami Exchange repository! This repository contains the smart contract code for the first perpetual futures decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol on the TON blockchain. The Tsunami Exchange allows users to trade futures contracts with no expiration date, providing a unique trading experience compared to traditional futures exchanges. The platform's aim is to provide a secure, transparent, and efficient trading environment for its users.

This repository contains the smart contract code for Tsunami Exchange written in FunÐ¡ programming language, as well as the tests and scripts written in Typescript.

## Architecture overview

Hackaton protocol smart contracts system consists of three key components:

- `Oracle`. Sharded smart contract, contains exactly one index price. Can set it's price after `set_oracle_price` call by `manager_addr`. Oracle receives `oracle_price_request` and responds with `oracle_price_response` opcode to the corresponding `redirect_addr` with the corresponding price_data.
- `Position wallet`. Sharded smart contract. It contains the latest position for a specific trader. It provides its data every time a request is sent to the vAMM contract, which implies a change in trader position data. Afrer every `provide_position` request contract locks it data, waiting for vAMM's response to prevent double spending or data inconsistency caused by asynchronous TON architecture. Contract unlocks it's state after `unlock_position` or `update_position` vAMM's messages.
- `vAMM`. Handles all the exchange operations with corresponding handler, position data and oracle price

### vAMM main handlers:

- `increase_position`: This function allows users to open a new position or increase their opened position in a perpetual futures contract by buying more of the underlying asset. Takes `amount`, `direction`, `leverage`, `min_base_asset_amount`, previous `position_ref` and last oracle `price_ref`.

- `add_margin`: This function allows users to add more collateral to their open position in order to increase their margin and reduce the risk of liquidation. This function allows users to open a new position or increase their opened position in a perpetual futures contract by buying more of the underlying asset. Takes `amount`, previous `position_ref` and last oracle `price_ref`.

- `close_position`: This function allows users to close their open position in a perpetual futures contract by selling the underlying asset. Takes `_size`, `_minQuoteAssetAmount`, flag `_addToMargin`, previous `position_ref` and last oracle `price_ref`.

- `remove_margin`: This function allows users to withdraw excess collateral from their open position. Takes `_amount`, previous `position_ref` and last oracle `price_ref`.

- `remove_margin`: This function allows users to withdraw excess collateral from their open position. Takes `_amount`, previous `position_ref` and last oracle `price_ref`.

- `pay_funding`: This function allows users to pay the funding rate for holding a perpetual futures position. Perpetual futures contracts typically have a funding rate that is paid periodically to ensure that the price of the futures contract stays in line with the underlying asset. Takes last oracle `price_ref`.

- `liquidate`: : This function allows the exchange to automatically liquidate a user's open position if it becomes under-collateralized. Can be called by anyone. Takes `to_liquidate_address`, previous `position_ref` and the last oracle `price_ref`.

More concrete schemes can be found in corresponding `contracts/*.tlb` scheme annotations.

Below is an illustration of the call chain of smart contracts called by the `increase_position` method:

### Hackathon limitations

- Oracle is centralized, will need to add ability to decentralization;
- Order Book is not implemented (but is researched), only Market Orders;
- Liquidity is stored in vAMM market contracts, no Vault yet. Later, protocol will be updated with a single smart contract entry point, collecting the collateral amount and redirecting all the incoming transactions.
- Fee sharing between LP and yield token staking is not implemented.

## Layout

This project was bootstraped using [Blueprint](https://github.com/ton-community/Blueprint) ðŸ’™

- `contracts` - contains the source code of all the smart contracts of the project and their dependencies.
- `wrappers` - contains the wrapper classes (implementing `Contract` from ton-core) for the contracts, including any [de]serialization primitives and compilation functions.
- `tests` - tests for the contracts.
- `scripts` - contains scripts used by the project, mainly the deployment scripts.

## How to use

- Clone this repo
- Run `yarn install`

### Testing

Run tests:

```sh
yarn test
```

Or only vAMM related tests:

```sh
yarn test:vamm
```

Tests are writen with [@ton-community/sandbox](https://github.com/ton-community/sandbox).
